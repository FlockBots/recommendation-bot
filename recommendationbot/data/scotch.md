Hi there, I’m a bot here to help you with your recommendation post. If you haven’t already, please review [the guides](https://docs.google.com/document/d/186_ANEKW8yGvvLAcjKve6tvqqBIcMGUg9-mKU5KACZk/edit) in the sidebar we’ve created to address the stream of recommendation posts we get here. Most notably:

* [Recommendations for Beginners](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PX70tHEc5v-Te8FiCLmRfmHel6Er5YZP_TnYKAdTAVo/edit)
* [Next Level Malt Recommendations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZPGmllteXF99KcQgjcNwgdY7_DCEQ8Cdil1IJklKoUE/edit#heading=h.i23il3ual5dx)

* [Malt Map](http://scotchgit.bitbucket.io/)

The malt map can be especially valuable for exploring different flavor zones and for identifying scotches similar to a particular bottle you enjoy.

&nbsp;

Please try to be as specific and detailed as possible with your request. Tell us:

* your budget
* which whiskies you or your giftee have enjoyed
* which bottles you’re considering now
* where you live (pricing and availability can vary dramatically by region)
* if your shop has a limited selection or you might have trouble shipping bottles so we don’t recommend something obscure

**General Tips**    
We generally advise novices to sample as much as possible by going to a bar, splitting bottles with friends, attending festivals/tastings or getting minis to ensure you buy bottles you enjoy. Most people need to try at least 20-25 scotches to understand their preferences. It may make more sense for you to focus on sampling rather than buy full bottles at the beginning of your journey.

You're going to get the most flavor/aroma drinking it neat in a tulip-shaped glass like a Glencairn but most new drinkers prefer to water down their whisky a bit. If you do end up adding water, we usually recommend adding just enough to make it tolerable and take small sips. But really there's no right or wrong way to drink so as long as you're enjoying it, you're doing it right. Thanks for reading, cheers!
